        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Strapatsada (also called kagianas), is a Greek summer side dish from Arcadia and is ideal to accompany BBQ and grilled meat dishes.</p>
        <p>This could have been their breakfast or main meal served with some Greek salad and lots of crusty bread</p>
        <p>This dish, which at the Ionian islands is called strapatsada, took its name from the Italian verb strapazzare, which means to handle roughly (to beat).</p>
        <p>In other parts of Greece it is called Kagianas,  Kaikanas or just tomatoes with eggs, as we used to call it in Cyprus.</p>
        <p>It is a traditional Greek summer dish from Arcadia where poor people would eat out of the products they had at hand.  Some tomatoes from their garden and eggs from their hens.</p>
        <p><strong>Pronunciation:</strong>strapa-tza-Da</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten lightly</li>
            <li>¼ cup feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the ends off of each tomato. Grate the tomatoes, until all that’s left is the tomato skin. Reserve the grated tomatoes and discard skins.</li>
            <li>In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté the onions and the garlic until they become translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes and season with chili flakes, oregano, salt and pepper. Cook until the tomato juices have mostly evaporated.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beaten eggs and mix with a wooden spoon to combine. Add more seasoning if desired.</li>
            <li>Cook until the eggs begin to set, careful not to overcook. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Top with feta, drizzle with olive oil, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
