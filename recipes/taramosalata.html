        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Taramosalata is a meze made from tarama, the salted and cured roe (colloquially referred to as caviar) of the cod, carp, or grey mullet (bottarga) mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, and a starchy base of bread or potatoes, or sometimes almonds.</p>
        <p>Traditionally the dish is made with a pestle and mortar, giving a slightly grainy texture, but commercial taramasalata is commonly blended to a very smooth paste.</p>
        <p>Taramosalata is usually served as a meze, often with ouzo, as a spread on bread.The colour can vary from creamy beige to pink, depending on the type of roe and colourings used. Most taramosalata sold commercially is dyed pink, but high quality taramasalata is always beige in colour.</p>
        <p>In Greece, taramosalata is often served on Clean Monday (Καθαρά Δευτέρα, Kathará Deftéra), the first day of Great Lent, with onions and lemon.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1/2 cup (120 grams) water</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion (optional)</li>
            <li>4 slices (100 grams) white sandwich bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons (45 grams) good quality white tarama (fish roe)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (30 grams) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>a pinch of sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (55 grams) mild olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup (230 grams) sunflower oil</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cooking Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend the onion with the water for a few seconds, then pass the mixture through a strainer and collect 1/2 a cup (120 grams) of onion water (this method gives some onion flavor to the taramosalata without making it too heavy)</li>
            <li>Process: Transfer the bread, the fish roe (tarama), the lemon juice, the pinch of sugar, the onion water and the olive oil to the bowl of a food processor and blend for 1-2 minutes until everything is smooth and homogenized.

                With the machine running, add the sunflower oil gradually in a thin stream. As you add the oil the mixture will start to thicken (it's the same thing as making mayonnaise). Scrape the bowl with a spatula and process for one more minute.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust the lemon juice and the salt if needed. Serve or transfer to an airtight food container and store in the fridge for up to 10 days.</li>
        </ol>
